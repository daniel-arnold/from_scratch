# from_scratch
## ML/Optimization examples implemented from scratch.
 
 This codebase is designed to build intuition behind commonly used functions in ML and optimization.  Right now, the codebase includes examples of:
 <ol>
 <li>KMeans clustering</li>
 <li>Principal Component Analysis (PCA): scratch method uses power iteration to compute singular values and eigenvectors</li>
 <li>Linear Regression: linear regression over multiple independent variables.  Parameter estimated determined via solving the normal equation, gradient descent, and stochastic (mini-batch) gradient descent</li>
 <li>Solution to system of linear equations Ax=b using steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods</li>
 <li>Logistic Regression</li>
 <li>Softmax Classification with L2 Regularization</li>
 </ol>
