# from_scratch
 ML/Optimization examples implemented from scratch.
 
 This codebase is designed to build intuition behind commonly used functions in ML and optimization.  Right now, the codebase includes examples of:
 
  - KMeans clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA): scratch method uses power iteration to compute singular values and eigenvectors
  - Linear Regression: linear regression over multiple independent variables.  Parameter estimated determined via solving the normal equation, gradient descent, and stochastic (mini-batch) gradient descent
  - Solution to system of linear equations $Ax=b$ using steepest descent and conjugate gradient methods
